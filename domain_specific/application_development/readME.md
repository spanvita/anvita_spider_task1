This is a web application for a game Disc Battle 4. I have incorporated all the requirements upto level 3.
There are two, light and dark modes, which are interconverible, on the click of an icon.
The usage of power ups and special buttons follow certain rules (to ensure that players use these in their own turn):
1. Undo can be performed only once, after a coin (gold/ruby) has been placed. (this is because, if the gold player uses undo after blocking, it would be using the ruby's time and if it allows multiple undos, it would undo the blocked column by ruby, which should not be allowed to be done by gold)
2. replay is allowed only at the end of gameplay.
3. Extra time and Time thief can be used in the player's own turn (just before placing coin or just before blocking)
4. Another move is meant for the same player to place their coin twice. This can be availed right after the first coin is placed.
5. Block unblocked is used to remove the block of a column placed by the opponent. This can be availed right before placing a coin.
6. Each power ups can be used only once by each player.
Leaderboard displays the locally stored scores and number of games played.
Audio with toggle buttons have been incorporated.
Timer is placed for both players.
